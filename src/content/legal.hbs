            <h2>Applicable Laws</h2>

            <p>This Service is controlled by Red9 from its offices within the
                United States of America. Red9 makes no representation that the
                Content in the Service or the Service are appropriate or
                available for use in other locations, and access to them from
                territories where their content or use is illegal is prohibited.
                Those who choose to access this Service from locations outside
                of the United States do so on their own initiative and are
                responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may
                not use or export the Content in violation of U.S. export laws
                and regulations. Any action related to the Service, the Content
                or the Terms shall be governed by California law and controlling
                U.S. federal law, without regard to conflicts of laws thereof.
                You hereby consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
                venue in the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles
                County, California for any legal proceedings related to the
                Service or the Terms. If any party hereto brings any suit or
                action against another for relief, declaratory or otherwise,
                arising out of these Terms, the prevailing party will have and
                recover against the other party, in addition to all court costs
                and disbursements, such sum as the court may adjudge to be
                reasonable attorneys’ fees. Except to the extent prohibited by
                applicable law, the parties agree that any claim or cause of
                action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the
                Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or

                Terms.</p>

            <h2>General</h2>

            <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment or
                agency relationship exists between you and Red9 as a result of
                the Terms or your use of the Service. The Terms constitute the
                entire agreement between you and Red9 with respect to your use
                of the Service. The failure of Red9 to exercise or enforce any
                right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of
                such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found
                by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
                nevertheless agree that the court should give effect to the
                parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
                provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. You may
                not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer your account or your
                obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent
                of Red9. Red9 has the right, in its sole discretion, to transfer
                or assign all or any part of its rights under these Terms and
                will have the right to delegate or use third party contractors
                to fulfill its duties and obligations under these Terms and in
                connection with the Service. Red9’s notice to you via email,
                regular mail or notices or links on the Service shall constitute
                acceptable notice to you under the Terms. A printed version of
                the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
                admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon
                or relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the
                same conditions as other business documents and records
                originally generated and maintained in printed form. Section
                titles and headings in the Terms are for convenience only and
                have no legal or contractual effect. Any rights not expressly
                granted herein are reserved.</p>

            <h2>Amendment of Terms</h2>

            <p>Red9 may amend these Terms from time to time by posting an
                amended version at its website and sending you written notice
                thereof. Such amendment will be deemed accepted and become
                effective 30 days after such notice (the “Proposed Amendment
                Date”). However, if you are a Red9 Premium Member, have prepaid
                for your Red9 account and give Red9 written notice of rejection
                of the amendment prior to the Proposed Amendment Date, these
                Terms will continue under their original provisions and the
                amendment will become effective at your next subscription
                renewal date. If you are not a Red9 Premium Member and object to
                any such changes, your sole recourse shall be to discontinue use
                of the Service. Your continued use of the Service following the
                Proposed Amendment Date will constitute your acceptance of such
                changes.</p>

            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>Last Updated: September 1, 2015</p>

            <p>Red9 Instruments Corporation (“RED9”) collects certain
                information through its website located at www.red9sensor.com,
                its connected devices and any mobile or downloaded software
                applications provided by RED9 (together the “Service”). This
                Privacy Policy lays out RED9’s policies and procedures
                surrounding the collection and handling of any such information
                that identifies an individual user or that could be used to
                contact or locate him or her (“Personal Data”).</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. It does not
                apply to any third party site, service or software linked to the
                Service or recommended or referred by our Service or by our
                staff.
                We welcome your comments or questions regarding this Privacy
                Policy. </p>

            <h2>A. Personal Data We Collect</h2>

            <p>Personal Data Collected. RED9 collects certain personally
                identifiable information from users of the Service, such as a
                user’s name, address, phone number, and email address. For paid
                versions of the Service, RED9 requires you to provide RED9 with
                payment and billing information, such as billing name and
                address and credit card number. All of this information is
                considered “Personal Data”. Ways we collect Personal Data
                include:</p>

            <p>User Accounts. When you create an account, we may require you to
                provide information used to identify you. We may indicate that
                some information is required for you to register for the
                account, while other information is optional.</p>

            <p>Device Usage. RED9’s devices (and any devices that connect to the
                Service) collect GPS and other information that identify where
                you surfed and how much stoke you got.</p>

            <p>Correspondence. If you contact us by email, through a contact
                form on our websites, or by mail, text, fax, or other means, we
                collect the Personal Data contained within, and associated with,
                your correspondence.</p>

            <p>Email Newsletters. We may offer email newsletters from time to
                time. If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we collect
                your email address.</p>

            <p>Social Networking. Personal Data about your surf sessions will be
                publicly available on your Service profile unless you restrict
                who can view your profile. If you post comments, message or
                otherwise interact with other users, any Personal Data you
                provide may be viewed by RED9, other users of the Service and
                the general public </p>

            <p>Cookies and Other Tracking Technology. Our website(s) may use
                cookies, Flash cookies, javascript, clear gifs, navigational
                data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), third party services
                such as Google Analytics, and other tracking technologies (“Data
                Tools”). We use these Data Tools to analyze trends, administer
                the site, track visitors’ movements around the site and to
                gather demographic information about our user base as a whole
                (“Site Data”). We may receive reports based on the use of Data
                Tools by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated
                basis.</p>

            <p>We use cookies to remember user actions and settings on our
                websites, such as language preferences. Users can control the
                use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject
                cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use
                some features or areas of the sites may be limited.</p>

            <h2>B. Our Use of Personal Data</h2>

            <p>Use of Personal Data. We use your Personal Data to create your
                account, to communicate with you about your use of the Service,
                to offer you additional products and services, and to bill you
                if you are an administrator of your company’s account. We also
                use that information to the extent necessary to enforce our
                Terms of Service and to prevent imminent harm to persons or
                property.</p>

            <p>Use of Tracking Information. We use Data Tools so that our
                websites can remember you and provide you with the information
                you’re most likely to need. For instance, if account login
                features are provided on our websites, cookies may identify you
                and prompt the site to provide your username and/or password so
                you can sign in more quickly. We may also use information gained
                through Data Tools to compile Site Data as described above. </p>

            <h2>C. Protection of Personal Data</h2>

            <p>RED9 uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the
                confidentiality of your personally identifiable information,
                such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. We make reasonable
                efforts to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of
                the information under our control. In addition, we always use a
                secure connection when collecting financial information from
                you. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be
                guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

            <p>Your RED9 account is password-protected so in addition to those
                partners or agents who may provide you services, only you and
                those you designate can access it and view the user information
                relevant to your account. Ultimately, you are responsible for
                maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account
                information. Remember to log out of your RED9 account and close
                your browser window when you are done. This ensures that others
                cannot access your personal information if your computer is
                accessible to others.</p>

            <h2>D. Third Party Access to Personal Data</h2>

            <p>Third Party Service Providers. We may share your Personal Data
                with third party service providers under contract to perform
                functions on our behalf. Examples include billing services,
                sending postal mail or e-mail, storing data, analyzing data,
                performing quality assurance, providing technical support,
                providing marketing assistance, verifying identity, processing
                employment applications, and providing customer service. These
                third parties may have access to your Personal Data only as
                needed to perform their functions. RED9 may transfer Personal
                Data to companies that help us provide our Service. Transfers to
                these third parties are covered by the provisions in this
                Privacy Policy regarding accessing, correcting and removing
                Personal Data.</p>

            <p>Acquirors. We may share your Personal Data with any company that
                acquires our company or our assets. That company will possess
                the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and
                obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this
                Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>Related Companies. We may share your Personal Data with our
                subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common
                control, in which case we will require them to honor this
                Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>Legal Requests. We may disclose your Personal Data if we have a
                good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to: (1) comply
                with the law or with legal process served on us or to cooperate
                with any legal investigation; (2) protect and defend the rights
                or property of us or our users; (3) act in an emergency to
                protect someone’s safety; or (4) investigate any violation or
                potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, applicable
                Service restrictions, any other agreements between you and RED9
                or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal
                liability.</p>

            <p>Consent. We may share your Personal Data if you provide us prior
                consent to do so. </p>

            <p>Use and Disclosure of Service Data. We have the right to use and
                share aggregate, anonymized information we obtain through our
                analysis of user’s Personal Data (“Service Data”) for any
                purpose and in any manner; provided, however if Service Data
                contains Personal Data we will either (i) obtain your express
                permission, or (ii) exclude your Personal Data from such Service
                Data. </p>

            <h2>E. Accessing, Correcting and Removing Your Personal Data</h2>

            <p>Changing and Removing Personal Data. You can access and change
                any Personal Data we store through your account. You may request
                us to delete your Personal Data by sending us an e-mail or
                postal mail at the address above, but please note that we may be
                required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not
                delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in
                which case we will comply with your deletion request only after
                we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any
                information, it will be deleted from the active database, but
                may remain in our archives. We will respond to requests for
                access within 30 days. </p>

            <p>Communication Preferences. We may periodically send you free
                newsletters, emails or text messages about new services,
                products, or other noteworthy news, or that may contain
                advertisements for third parties. When you receive newsletters
                or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a
                preference to stop receiving further communications from us and
                you will have the opportunity to opt out by following the
                unsubscribe instructions provided in the message you receive, or

                updates to our Privacy Policy or other terms for the
                Service. </p>
