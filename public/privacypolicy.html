<h2>redninesensor.com Privacy Policy</h2>

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how 

their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and

contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy 

policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your 

Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

<h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post 

a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in 

the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable 

information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly 

the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with 

this policy. - See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_new">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

Users can visit our site anonymously

Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the 

first significant page after entering our website.

Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified 

above.

Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page and are able to change their personal information by emailing us.

<h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online 

Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s 

consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and 

online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.

We do not intentionally gather PII about visitors who are under the age of 13.
