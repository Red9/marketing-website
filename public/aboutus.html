	<h2>Data is empowering.</h2> 
	<p>With data, experiences become tangible, more visceral and emotional. Our mission is to transform subjective, difficult to measure activities into data that is quantifiable and objective. As enthusiasts, we set out to be better at the things we love the most. How can an athlete systematically improve performance? How can the athlete digitally record, analyze, and share one’s most memorable activities? Red9’s mission is to give athletes the tools that measure and quantify every movement, because Every Move Counts. Red9 was created to bridge the gap between the subjective and the objective and enable the quantified surfer.

	Red9’s technology platform records motion with the Red9 Sensor and processes that data on Red9’s Data Science Platform. The Red9 Data Science Platform is designed to process large volumes of raw time-series data through a series of advanced machine learning algorithms that identify and translate surfing moves. We are not a location tracker or fitness device. It’s a data science platform that will help you visualize the way you move and tell a story at the same time.
